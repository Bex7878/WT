            <p>An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies. As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self-defense. In time, his master's true killer was revealed, and his brother mysteriously returned from death, yet Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done. Now, he wanders the world with only the wind to guide his blade.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Magical: Yasuo was born with natural magical ability, but in choosing to become a warrior he almost never practiced using his magical powers except for simple but useful attacks.</li>
                <li>Wind Magic: Yasuo was born with the magical ability to manipulate wind and air currents, giving him the ability to create air-based shields, conjure tornadoes, or even wind-powered flight.</li>
                <li>Possible Future Old Yasuo: Even weakened and old, Yasuo presents such a strong domino of his magical abilities that he can attack and cause great damage to criminals and robbers in a small village with attacks with his sword in the power of other elements besides of the wind also showing his knowledge and mastery in controlling elements in the chronology of a solitary future well demonstrated in his old man skin.</li>
                <li>Master Swordsmanship: Yasuo is a very skilled swordsman combining his ninja techniques with his magical abilities giving him the ability to launch direct or distant attacks, he is only rivaled by his brother Yone, and probably Master Yi if they came to fight.</li>

            <p>A leader of Ionia’s growing criminal underworld, Sett rose to prominence in the wake of the war with Noxus. Though he began as a humble challenger in the fighting pits of Navori, he quickly gained notoriety for his savage strength, and his ability to take seemingly endless amounts of punishment. After fighting his way through the ranks of local combatants, Sett muscled to the top, seizing control of the pits he once fought in.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vastayan Physiology: Sett is a the son of a vastayan woman and a human man, granting him a unique nature. It's unknown how much of his vastayan heritage he carries within him.</li>
                <li>Kinetic Absorption: Sett can absorb the energy created by attacks thrown at him to strengthen himself, storing that energy to enhance his physical skills to better defeat his foes. Once he absorbs the energy, he can them release it in his attacks, creating destructive waves of energy through his punches easily devastating all his foes nearby.</li>
                <li>Magical Pulling: Sett can "pull" others towards him, immobilizing and rendering them defenseless.</li>

        <div class="sylastxt">
            <p>Raised in one of Demacia’s lesser quarters, Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolize the darker side of the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served… and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Magical Physiology: Sylas was born with natural magic abilities that can improve as he trains. Though he initially trained under the Mageseekers, who weaponized his abilities for their own agendas, he trained and honed his abilities further while in prison.</li>
                <li>Magic Sight: Sylas was born with the ability to see magic in the form of visual colors, particularly when it emanates off of other mages. Because of this special skill, Sylas was inducted into the Mageseekers at a young age, who weaponized his ability to hunt down mages hiding in Demacia.</li>
                <li>Magic Absorption & Replication: Sylas has the innate ability to absorb magical energy into himself, allowing him to almost perfectly replicate other magical abilities.[1] Sylas can absorb magic by simply touching another mage, but he can also absorb energy from inherently magical materials, notably petricite that has already absorbed residual magic. Sylas's absorption isn't exclusive to mages and he has shown that he's capable of absorbing and mimicking the magical abilities of magical fauna. Though the extent of this ability isn't fully known, it may improve as Sylas learns to absorb other forms of magical energy.</li>
                <li>Elemental Magic Absorption: Sylas can absorb and replicate almost every form of Elemental magic, such as how he replicated Lux's light magic.</li>
                <li>Iceborn Frost Resistance: Sylas is capable of absorbing the innate abilities of the Iceborn, perfectly mimicking their resistance to cold temperatures and possibly granting him the ability to wield True Ice.</li>
                <li>Celestial Magic Absorption: By tapping into the residual magic energies left within ancient petricite structures, Sylas can absorb the Celestial magics of Kayle and Morgana, who have inherent abilities tied to the Aspects.</li>
                <li>Blessing of The Veiled Lady: During the Great Mage Rebellion, Sylas was granted a magical blessing by Morgana Morgana herself, granting him some of her abilities and empowering his innate talent to harness other magics.</li>
                <li>Petricite Shackles: In combat, Sylas uses the same petricite shackles that bound him in prison. Using these chains, Sylas can expel magical energies absorbed through the petricite, absorb magic that touches his chains and strike enemies with intense physical force.</li>
